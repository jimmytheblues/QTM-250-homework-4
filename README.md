# QTM-250-homework-4
This repository includes all the files and images (both original and editted) for homework 4. All the images are placed in the folder "hw4 photo". All photos in the folder was analyzed using Cloud Vision API. The notebook file contained the introduction of this project, the variables and methods used for analysis, and the graphs for the results. We used the confidence score given by the Cloud Vision API to determine the difference of the degree of "reality" of the photo before and after the photo was edited using iphone 13pro's photo editing techiniques (adjusting the saturation and vibrance of each photo to 50). The spreadsheet was used to make the graphs for visualization. The graphs were all bar graphs, with the x-axis indicating the photo name, and the y-axis for the confidence score. The colab notewook is attached for details.
